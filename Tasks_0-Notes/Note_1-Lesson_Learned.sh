Note 1 - Lesson Learned

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# LESSON LEARNED:

1.	EXPIRE AFTER 2 DAYS
	Tasks expire after 2 days. Once you fail the lab, you will not be able to retry it again afterward. You will have to  wait for it to be assigned    

2.	FAILED LABS
	If you fail the lab, you will not be able to retry it again afterward. You will have to wait for it to be assigned 
	to you again in the future.
	
	* EDIT - 05-JUL-2020
	When the timer stops or when so hit "FINISH", you will immediately see if you if you succeed or failed the task.
	
3.	"TRY LATER" TO REDO LAB.
	If you are running out of time and not confident with the result, you can hit "TRY LATER"  to put the task in
	"PENDING" state. Tasks that are in this stated can be retried multiple times until you succeed or until
	the task/s expires.		

4. 	DUPLICATE TABS
	Make it a practice nextime to open a duplicate task dashboard in another tab.
	This is in case you fail thee lab the first time, you can still retry the lab on the second tab.
   
	* EDIT - 05-JUL-2020
	This may need further tests in th future to be validated if this can really be done.
	
5. 	REMAINING 5 MINUTES
	After the timer stops, you still have 5 minutes to continue your work. Make sure to use this time wisely.
	Try to resolve or do the remaining steps within this 5 minutes.
   
6. 	LESS DOCUMENTATION DURING LAB
	Do not spend too much time on the documentation. Solve the issue/task first and then once everything is working,
	then do the documentation. Do not do the documentation while the clock is running.
	You will have plenty of time doing the documentation after the lab is solved and the time has finished.
	
7.	FASTER TIME = HIGHER BONUS POINTS
	The faster you do and succeed a lab, the higher is the bonus points.
	If you finish the lab within 10 mins, you get 100 bonus points on top of the 200 experience points.
	If you finish the lab within 20 mins, you get 60 bonus points on top of the 200 experience points.

8.	DONOT GET STUCK
	When it seems unsolvable, take a break and rest. 
	During my first 400-point lab, everything seem to miraculuosly work well after I took a break.
