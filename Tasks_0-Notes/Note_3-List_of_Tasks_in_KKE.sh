**Hey there again, past self!**

Update - 28-Nov-2020

Just reached the 25,000 mark!
After some 5 months of constantly doing the tasks and of course scouring the internet and the KodeKloud community 
on how other people approached the tasks, we're now able to close the 25K mark with the recent 52nd task.

I thnk it's also worth mentioning the tasks that you've resolved in the past but appeared again.
It's like seeing the problem with fresh sight but with much more confidence working in Linux.
Really enjoyed how the tasks simulate actual tickets at work. Kudos to mumshad and team!

First target, done!
Lot more to learn, lot more to go!
Next up, 100K!

Alright, onto the next mile marker we go!
